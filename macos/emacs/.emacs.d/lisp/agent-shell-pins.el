;;; agent-shell-pins.el --- Pinned @-file aliases for agent-shell -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Short handles for files you want @-mentionable from ANY project.
;; Typing @rig in an agent-shell (or its minibuffer composer) completes
;; like a project file regardless of the shell's project; on submit the
;; alias is rewritten to its full path just before agent-shell parses
;; mentions, so the agent receives the actual file content while the
;; prompt stays clean.
;;
;; Managing pins:
;;   - M-x agent-shell-pins-add     — pick a file (find-file style), name it;
;;                                    live immediately AND persisted here
;;   - M-x agent-shell-pins-remove  — unpin, live + persisted
;;   - M-x agent-shell-pins-reload  — after HAND-editing the alist below;
;;                                    needed because re-loading a defvar
;;                                    never overwrites the live value
;;
;; NOTE: loaded from agent-shell-config.el — must not hard-require
;; agent-shell (Elpaca hasn't activated packages yet in batch mode).
;; Both advices attach fine to not-yet-defined functions.
