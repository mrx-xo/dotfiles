;;; major-pane.el --- Toggle agent-shell side panel -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Cmd+i to toggle agent-shell as a left side panel.
;; C-u Cmd+i to toggle full-frame mode with layout restore.
;; When no agent-shell buffer exists, shows a launcher menu.
;; Includes a buffer picker (consult or hydra+posframe) for choosing
;; among multiple agent-shell conversations, with per-action config.
;;
;; IMPORTANT — routing conversations into the pane:
;;   Many code paths display agent-shell buffers (agent-shell itself,
;;   agent-recall resume, plain pop-to-buffer callers).  To make ALL of
;;   them land in the major-pane with state kept in sync, add
;;   `major-pane-display-buffer-action' to `display-buffer-alist' in
;;   your USER CONFIG (e.g. emacs.org), not in this file:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist
;;                  '("Claude Agent @" (major-pane-display-buffer-action)))
;;
;;   Keeping `agent-shell-display-action' set to a matching
;;   display-buffer-in-direction action is a harmless fallback; the
;;   alist entry takes precedence whenever it matches.
